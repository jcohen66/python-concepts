Higher Ground Sun Valley,"Fly fishing, cycling, skiing, paddling, hiking, swimming, team sports (not specified), equine, rock climbing, billiards","﻿Back in 1999, we were really good at one thing: teaching locals with disabilities how to use adaptive skis. It took special equipment, understanding, and really, really remarkable coaches. Today, we still take to the mountain with our locals, but now our special equipment and special coaches transform lives across the country. From the hiking trails of western New York to the mountaintops of Idaho to the surf of Los Angeles, we are deploying the nation's top recreational therapists and mental health professionals to give people of all abilities (especially our nation's veterans) the emotional and social tools they need to feel like they belong.",https://highergroundusa.org/who-we-are/,﻿208-726-9298,Info@HigherGroundUSA.org,"﻿160 7th Street W Ketchum, ID 83340"

Adaptive Wilderness Sports of McCall (AweSOMe),"Skiing, snowboarding, canoeing, kayaking","﻿Providing participants and volunteers opportunities to learn new skills, challenge themselves, and work together to enhance the health and self-confidence necessary to expand human potential. Adaptive Wilderness Sports of McCall (AWeSOMe!), began as the vision of physical therapist, Ingrid Burica, and occupational therapist, Kirsten Evenson, in January, 2002 after receiving some used adaptive ski equipment as a donation from Recreation Unlimited of Boise at Bogus Basin Mountain Recreation Area.  The program was run at the Little Ski Hill during the first four years, in conjunction with the After-School Ski Program, allowing students with disabilities to ski alongside their non-disabled peers.  AWeSOMe! was then under the umbrella of the Little Ski Hill's non-profit status.  In the second year, Mary Naylor, then Brundage Mountain Resort's Director of Marketing, offered to write a grant, which was procured from the University of Idaho’s Assistive Technology Department to purchase some new adaptive ski equipment.  The program then moved to Brundage Mountain Resort to take advantage of the beginner chairlift and more diverse terrain.  Moving the program to Brundage provided the opportunity to include adults with disabilities.  AWeSOMe! now receives generous support from Brundage Mountain through provision of in-kind lift tickets for students and instructors.  As the program grew, Brundage increased their support by donating the use of an A-frame hut, at the top of the Easy Street beginner area, for AWeSOMe!’s  base of operations.  In addition, Brundage provides ski rentals for AWeSOMe! students requiring stand-up ski equipment.  The relationship with the Brundage Ski School has grown to include some shared instructor training.",https://sites.google.com/awesomemccall.org/home/home?authuser=0,208-315-4275,info@awesomemccall.org,"McCall, ID"

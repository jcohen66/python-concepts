CAMC Health System ,Strengthening and endurance,"Physical inactivity, high blood pressure, and smoking are risk factors for heart disease. These risk factors can be reduced by living a healthy lifestyle, including exercise. Exercise may also protect against stroke. Walking, stair-climbing, dancing, jogging, and other activities of at least moderate intensity also reduce stroke risk. Plus, exercise can help you prevent or manage several chronic diseases that become more common with age: type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and arthritis.Both your body and mind can benefit from exercise. Exercise can help you manage stress. It's not clear whether stress affects the heart directly or has an effect on other risk factors and behaviors that affect the heart. These may include blood pressure, cholesterol levels, smoking, and overeating. Cutting down on stress, however, can at least make your life more enjoyable. Exercise can also boost your self-image and help counter anxiety and depression.",http://healthinfo.camc.org/Wellness/Fitness/Matters/1,304-388-5432,"Charleston, WV 25326",

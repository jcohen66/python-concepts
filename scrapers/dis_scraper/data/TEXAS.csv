University of Texas at Arlington,Bowling,"For any organization or movement to form, there has to be a need for that particular group.  In order to see the need there has to be a person or a group of people with vision.  In the case of the AWBA, that person was Richard F. Carlson. In the spring of 1962, Richard of Huntsville, Alabama came to Louisville, Kentucky to bowl in the annual Southern Bowling Congress Tournament.  That was unusual in that he bowled from a wheelchair which was a rarity in most sectional tournaments.  It was important as well since it provided him an opportunity to expound on the concept of creating a national organization dedicated to growing the sport of bowling from a wheelchair, an elusive dream he and a few cohorts had toyed with for some time.  His vision was grand, to conduct the first Annual National Wheelchair Bowling Tournament.  He took his ideas to the Greater Louisville Bowling Association, explaining that while the task was challenging, his commitment and dedication to the sport was up for such a challenge.  With the support of local businesses, Richard set out in an attempt to draw as many as 10 or 12 to the first National Wheelchair Bowling Tournament with Louisville as its first site.",https://awba.org/,713-444-7588,"16006 Congo Lane Houston, Texas 77040",info@awba.org

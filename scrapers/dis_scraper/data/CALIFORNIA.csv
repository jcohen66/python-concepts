﻿Achieve Tahoe,"Hiking, paddle sports, water skiing, canoeing, kayaking, sailing, jet-skiing, adaptive skiing, adaptive snowboarding","﻿Achieve Tahoe was started in 1967 by Jim Winthers, a World War II Veteran of the 10th Mountain Division and Director of the Soda Springs Ski School. He brought together a group of Vietnam Veterans with disabilities and they taught themselves how to ski and found ways to adapt equipment to do so. At the time, adaptive sports equipment did not exist. The experience was so positive, Jim felt that the community could benefit from a formalized program that helped more people. We are proud to be the founding chapter of MoveUnited (formerly Disabled Sports USA) and have employees and volunteers who were the pioneers in the adaptive sports world. Today, Achieve Tahoe provides year-round outdoor recreation activities for people with cognitive, sensory, and physical disabilities. We can serve just about anyone with any disability. We focus on health, confidence, and independence so that the experience people have with us is long-lasting and carries over into other areas of their life.",https://www.achievetahoe.org/support/,530-581-4161,info@achievetahoe.org,"2680 Alpine Meadows Road, CA 961462."

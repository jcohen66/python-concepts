Costal Adaptive Sports,"Basketball/wheelchair basketball, cycling, surfing, track and field","﻿Coastal Adaptive Sports is a non-profit organization dedicated to facilitating sports opportunities and scheduling recreation activities to enhance the lives of individuals and families who have disabilities. The president says: Sports have always been a passion of mine. When I had my accident eight years ago, leaving me a quadriplegic, I assumed participating in any of my passions was over. I definitely couldn't have imagined how wrong I was! Not until I found CAS did my life change for the better. I began as a participant loving being able to to get involved in all types of sports, especially two of my favorite sports in surfing and basketball. I soon became a board member and began our surfing program, Wheel to Surf, which is the most joyous thing I've ever been apart of. Now as the President, I have to say, I definitely never imagined being able to reach as many lives locally, across the country, and internationally as we have. It fills my heart to see the happiness in our participants and their families, and has shown me what my true purpose is in life. It can be said now that sports literally saved my life, and in turn has inspired me to devote myself to helping those in need to find that joy as well. It's a beautiful thing to see and be a part of, and I'm extremely grateful to all of those that make it happen.",https://www.coastaladaptivesports.org/about,﻿843-333-0489,coastaladaptivesports@gmail.com,"﻿Myrtle Beach, SC"

﻿USA Adaptive Water Ski and Wake Sports: Eastern Region ,Water ski and wake sports,"USA Adaptive Water Ski and Wake Sports’ goal is to get new skiers on the water, allowing them the independence and confidence that water skiing can bring. Those unable to stand to ski use a sit ski.  Sit skis are longer and wider than able bodied skis and include a metal seating frame (aka a cage). A narrower slalom course is an option for those whose disability is greater such as those with quadriplegia and athletes with both arm and leg disabilities. Those with vision impairment also use able bodied equipment; however they’re guided by another skier in the jumping event (guide cannot go over the ramp) and use audible signals instead of buoys in the slalom course.",https://www.usaadaptivewaterski.org/delaware,,Simon@adaptivewatersports.org,DE
